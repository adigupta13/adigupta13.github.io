Non fungible token celebrate the power of eternity and present us with a way to digitally store our most beloved priceless possessions. An NFT is a digital asset that represents real-world objects like art, music, in-game items and videos. They are bought and sold online, frequently with cryptocurrency, and they are generally encoded with the same underlying software as many cryptos.

The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a dramatic loss of human life worldwide and presented an unprecedented challenge to public health, food systems and the world of work. The economic and social disruption caused by the pandemic has been devastating: tens of millions of people are at risk of falling into extreme poverty. Despite all the challenges the pandemic has presented, many scientific groups have come out with vaccines that will help restore normalcy in our lives.

VacciNFT celebrates the brave fight humanity has put against this deadly virus and wants to store it for eternity. I want to thank every single person who has done their bit by helping as a frontline-worker, donating or staying at home to avoid the spread of virus and present them with these awesome NFT tokens which they can mint by uploading their pdf certificate of their vaccine shot.

India's vaccination rollout is enabled by a suite of open source technologies called [DIVOC](https://divoc.egov.org.in/). This has many layers of functionalities, ranging from logistics and distribution to pricing and certification. For this project, I needed to verify a user's vaccination certificate if it has the correct information inside and it is issued by the COWIN program and not faked. Rather than using a hosted server to validate and verify certificates, DIVOC encodes the certificate data, signs it using a set of public and private keys and zips the final output. this zipped binary is then converted to a QR code placed on your certificate. This uses a concept called Verificable Credentials or [VCs](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/) and is a relatively new standard to issue secure certificates.

The next time you take a look at your vaccination certificate, try scanning the QR with your phone. It would throw an error because the data in QR is in binary format and not UTF-8 encoded.

PDF.JS by mozilla comes to the rescue. Its amazing the capabilities this library has and how it allows me to carry out more complex parsing and manipulation of PDFs in frontend than some libs allow to perform in backend. Thankfully, the certificate issued by COWIN contains only one image layer, which when extracted can be pasted onto a canvas and retrieved as `ImageURI`. This URI is later passed to `zbar.wasm`. Have I ever discussed about the advantages of WebAssembly? zbar is a web assembly library written in C/C++ which allows me to convert the image of QR code directly to binary. Once the binary buffer is retrieved, its simply a job of unzipping the data and parsing the JSON out of it. The JSON presents us with a JWS (JSON Web Signature) which is the credential that needs to be authorized. After successful verification against COWIN provided public key, I have all the details I need, a user's name, and if its 1st or 2nd dose of the vaccine.

Using this data, I create a custom SVG with the user's name and dose number. This SVG is then uploaded to IPFS and the hash returned is used to form a metadata object. This metadata object contains essential details about an ERC-721 token for websites like OpenSea to get their content.

    },
}

The solidity contract governing COVAC token has been implemented with a limited number of tokens per users. Same certificate cannot be used to mint tokens again as certificateID is registered with the contract. A user also cannot mint 2 tokens of first dose. Finally, this contract was deployed on the Matic network. Call me a Polygon fanboy but you cannot deny the benefits of scaling acheived with their Layer 2 solutions.

- Less block time and faster transaction confirmation

- Significantly less gas fee

- Capabilities to connect with main ethereum network (Can be used to support legacy systems)

Finally, the metadata generated has to be available using a public URL. I chose to host both the SVG as well as the metdata JSON on IPFS. The IPFS url for the metadata has to be passed in the `_tokenURI` property present in OpenZepplin ERC-721 specification. And we are all done!
