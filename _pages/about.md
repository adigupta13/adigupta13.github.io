### What is decentralization?

I'm glad you asked. Decentralization is when we distribute the control of a service from one central authority to a bunch of people distributed and not related to each other. All people in this distributed network contribute towards maintainence of this service.

### How does this even work?

Imagine a bank where you deposited 100$. Now there are only 2 entities, namely the bank and you who know about this transaction. The trust between you and bank originates from the bank's history, integrity and value congruence. But if for any reason the bank decides not to honor your transaction, there is little you can do apart from complaining it to the law. Now imagine a network of several compute machines connected to each other, owned and maintianed by their respective owners, who are anonymous and unrelated to each other. This is a decentralized network. If we run a banking service on this network, when you make that 100$ deposit, everyone in the network will know that you made a deposit. And if one computer on the network decides not to acknowldge the transaction, it will be overriden by the majority score.

### That sounds a lot like democracy

You are absolutely right. Just like democracy, a decentralized service relies on its participants to keep it running efficiently and correctly.
